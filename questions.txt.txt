1. Describe Kubelet.

Kubelet - 
	* Primary node agent that runs on each node in K cluster.
	* Works in terms of Podspecs.
	* A podspec is a YAML or JSON object that describes a pod.
	* Kubelet receies podspec through API server
	API Server ---> podspecs ---> Kubelet.
	
	* Kubelet ensures that containers described in the podspecs are running and healthy.
	
Additional ways that Kubelet get podspecs

	1. File - --pod-manifest-path switch can be used to pass a path containing pods to run on startup. This path is rechecked every 20 sec ( configurable with a flag)
	2. HTTP endpoint - HTTP endpoint passed as a parameter on the command line. ( checked every 20 secs ( configurable))
	3. HTTP Server - The Kubelet can also listen for HTTP manifest posts.
	
2. How to stop all cluster components in Kubernetes? And remove cluster state?

Ans :
	1. Kill all process using kill command.
	
		sudo kill -SIGINT $(pidof kube-apiserver kubelet etcd)
	
	2. Before you restart your cluster, clear the kube-apiserver cluster state by removing etcd backing store.
	
		$rm -RF ~/default.etcd/
		
	3. Kubelet also caches its state on disk.   You can eliminate Kubelet's cached state by stopping kubelet and then removing the kubelet's backing store as well.
	
		$ sudo rm -RF /var/lib/kubelet
	** This is a good remedy for components that will not restart due to preexisting state that is out of synch with the rest of the cluster
	
	4. Recheck all of the Kubernetes services are stopped.
	
		$ pidof etcd kube-apiserver kubelet
	
	
	5. In addition to K8s components, we need to clean up what Docker is currently running.
	
		$ docker container rm $(docker container stop $(docker container ls -qa ))
